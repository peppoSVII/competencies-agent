# API Configuration
# It's recommended to use environment variables for sensitive data like API tokens.
# Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following content:
# JIRA_SERVER=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
# JIRA_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
# JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token
# SLACK_API_TOKEN=your_slack_api_token

# General Settings
# Number of days to look back for activities (used in the old keyword-based approach)
days_to_look_back: 14
# Start date for fetching Jira tickets (YYYY-MM-DD). If not provided, it defaults to 365 days ago.
start_date: "2024-01-01"

# The 'competencies' section is no longer used. The script now reads the competency matrix directly from Competency_matrix.csv.
